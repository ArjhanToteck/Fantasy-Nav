# Fantasy Nav
This is mostly just a tech demo/prototype for a map-based game I was thinking of making in Godot. It is simply an app that displays the real-world area around you in the style of a fantasy map. Go to the [releases](https://github.com/ArjhanToteck/Fantasy-Nav/releases) page to download and install.
