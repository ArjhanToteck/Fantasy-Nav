# Fantasy Nav
This is mostly just a tech demo/prototype for a map-based game I was thinking of making in Godot. It is simply an app that displays the real-world area around you in the style of a fantasy map. Go to the [releases](https://github.com/ArjhanToteck/Fantasy-Nav/releases) page to download and install.

# Real-World Map Data
The app uses the free and open source [Open Street Map project](https://www.openstreetmap.org/) for data.

# Art
All images and artwork used are available for free use under the public domain (CC0) from various sources, with some of my own modifications. Thank you especially to [nicubunu](https://nicubunu.ro/start) for the art used for most of the building icons, you should check out their stuff.

# TODO:
- Make available for Windows, Mac, and Linux (can't do web because Godot 4 doesn't support C# for that yet, but maybe I'll suck it up and use gdscript)
- Smooth camera movement
- Draw multipolygons and relations too
- Texture forests with trees, grass with grass blades, scrub with bushes, etc.
